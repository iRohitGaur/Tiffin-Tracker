# Tiffin-Tracker

Tiffin Tracker helps you manage your tiffin deliveries.

If you avail food delivery services (or tiffins) frequently, especially in a weekly pattern, it could get difficult to remember the exact days you have or haven't received the services of the vendor and when to pay them. Tiffin Tracker is your buddy that keeps a tab on this!

Set the dates on which the tiffins get delivered to you, the cost per tiffin and the updated balance.

The app will automatically mark a delivered date and manage balance based on your settings.

You can always de-select a delivery date in case the tiffin was not actually delivered on a particular date. Simplistic and effective in ensuring on-time (and accurate) payments!
